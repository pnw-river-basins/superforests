# Why this article
They use 14C data to identify the amount and age of carbon being transferred from Land to Ocean. A preliminary review suggests that the PNW rivers (Alsea, Umpqua) fall under the category Old-Young:

"The old–young mode is common in the Subarctic river–ocean continuum (Fig. [4c](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01476-4#Fig4)), western coast of the United States and coast of South Africa (Fig. [4a](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01476-4#Fig4) and Table [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01476-4#Tab1)). The annual export of riverine particles of old 14C ages (mainly petrogenic C) to these coastal regions is limited[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01476-4#ref-CR3 "Blair, N. & Aller, R. C. The fate of terrestrial organic carbon in the marine environment. Annu. Rev. Mar. Sci. 4, 401–423 (2012)."), with pulsed transport and burial of riverine OC occurring over days to weeks, associated with storms but possibly not captured in the sampling dates[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01476-4#ref-CR3 "Blair, N. & Aller, R. C. The fate of terrestrial organic carbon in the marine environment. Annu. Rev. Mar. Sci. 4, 401–423 (2012)."). The young (that is, recently produced) OC in these coastal sediments may mainly originate from marine primary productivity[27](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01476-4#ref-CR27 "Dai, Y. et al. Coastal phytoplankton blooms expand and intensify in the 21st century. Nature 614, 280–284 (2023).") (Supplementary Fig. [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01476-4#MOESM1))."

Yet, the riverine particle characterization for the PNW seems limited. On the other hand, the PNW coast has high water export (See Goni et al., ) but relatively low sediment and POC exports. Which seems counterintuitive given the large amount of precipitation and high primary productivity rates. So, where is all that Carbon?
